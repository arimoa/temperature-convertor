## About
In this program, the user can see the temperature in other temperature units. By entering the temperature in one of the desired units, the user sees its equivalent in other units.

If the user enters the desired temperature through the arrows placed in the input section, the temperature in the other two units will be automatically updated. But if he/she enters the temperature manually, he/she needs to press the Enter button to update the temperature in the other two units.
